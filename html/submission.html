 Detailed submission instructions

<br><br>

Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following
requirements before being submitted.<p>


<li>The paper must be original material that has not been previously
   published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under
   review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit
   material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted
   proceedings. <p>

<li> Your submission is limited to twenty two (22) 8.5"x11" double
   spaced pages, using 11pt or larger font. The page limit includes
   everything: references, title, figures, appendices, abstract, etc.
   Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be
   outright rejected at the discretion of the program chair.<p>

<li> Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on 8.5"x11"
   paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries
   where A4 paper is standard.<p>

<li> You may choose, but are not required, to list the authors and their
   affiliations on your submitted paper. The submitted papers will be
   reviewed by the program committee, assisted by outside referees.
   If you choose to submit your paper for double-blind review, please
   do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the
   reviewer unable to study the important prior work. Instead, if you
   are extending your own work, you need to either summarize this
   prior work in your submission or reference the prior work and
   discuss it in the third person, as if you were extending someone
   else's research.<p>
   
<li> Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and
   not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in
   the paper.<p>

<li> Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without
   the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on
   the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small.<p>

<li> Please number the pages.<p>

<li> The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other
   format, and we must be able to print the document just as we
   receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four
   widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol.<p>


For any additional information regarding your submission, please contact
the Program Chair, Michael D. Smith <a href="mailto:smith@eecs.harvard.edu">smith@eecs.harvard.edu</a><br>

<br>

Additional notes:<p>

<li>  As in last year's CGO conference, we will allow you (the authors)
   to view and respond to the reviews before the program committee
   meeting.  Please note that you will have only a couple of days to
   respond. The tentative plan calls for this response period to take
   place during some part of the week of October 27, 2003. Please plan
   accordingly.<p>


<li> Notification of acceptance will occur around mid-November 2003.
